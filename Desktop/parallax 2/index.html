            Nepal contains most of the Himalayas, the highest mountain range in
            the world. Eight of the fourteen eight-thousanders are located in
            the country, either in whole or shared across a border with China or
            India. Nepal has the highest mountain in the world, Mount Everest at
            an astonishing height of 8848m as well as 1,310 peaks over 6,000 m
            height

          Annapurna II is part of the Annapurna mountain range located in Nepal,
          and is the eastern anchor of the range.In terms of elevation,
          isolation (distance to a higher summit, namely Annapurna I East Peak,
          29.02 km or 18.03 mi) and prominence (2,437 m or 7,995 ft), Annapurna
          II does not rank far behind Annapurna I Main, which serves as the
          western anchor. It is a fully independent peak, despite the close
          association with Annapurna I Main which its name implies; it is,
          however, closely connected to the shorter Annapurna IV. Annapurna II
          is the 16th highest mountain in the world and second highest peak of
          the Annapurna range
        </p>

        <p>
          Annapurna II sits apart from the main ridge of the Annapurna Massif,
          along with the shorter Annapurna IV. Its summit proper lies along a
          steep rock ridge, relatively free of snow towards its highest point,
          which drops in altitude to run west to the summit of the smaller peak.
          The South Face is a large pyramidal wall only interrupted by the
          central spur, while the North Face is more complex, with steep walls
          cascading between ice fields near the summit and base of the mountain.
          To the northwest, a large hanging glacier occupies the flank between
          it and Annapurna IV, while the Northeastern wall has a distinctive,
          recurrent series of cornices and rock bands resembling a human face or
          skull, visible in the above photograph.

          Bouddha (Nepali: बौद्धनाथ; Newari: खास्ति चैत्य; Standard Tibetan:
          བྱ་རུང་ཁ་ཤོར།, romanized: Jarung Khashor, Wylie: bya rung kha shor),
          also known as Boudhanath, Khasti Chaitya and Khāsa Chaitya is a stupa
          in Kathmandu, Nepal.[2] Located about 11 km (6.8 mi) from the center
          and northeastern outskirts of Kathmandu, its massive mandala makes it
          one of the largest spherical stupas in Nepal[3] and the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          The stupa is said to entomb the remains of Kassapa Buddha.[4] It is
          located on the ancient trade route from Tibet which enters the
          Kathmandu Valley by the village of Sankhu in the northeast corner and
          continues to the ancient and smaller stupa of Chabahil named Charumati
          Stupa (often called "Little Boudhanath"). It then turns directly
          south, heading over the Bagmati River to Lalitpur, bypassing the main
          city of Kathmandu (which was built later).[2] Tibetan merchants have
          rested and offered prayers at Boudha Stupa for many centuries.
          Following the 1959 Tibetan uprising, a large number of the Tibetan
          refugees migrated to Nepal and settled down around Boudhanath.[5] The
          influx of the Tibetan refugees has seen the construction of over 50
          gompas (Budhhist monasteries) around Boudha. As of 1979, Boudha Stupa
          is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Along with Swayambhu, it is one of
          the most popular tourist sites in the Kathmandu area.

          Ramechhap District (Nepali: रामेछाप जिल्लाListenⓘ), a part of Bagmati
          Province, is a district of Nepal. The district, also known as Wallo
          Kirat Ramechhap, has its district headquarters in Manthali and covers
          an area of 1,546 km2 (597 sq mi). In 2011, the district had a
          population of 202,646[1] and population density of 137.4 per km2 (53.1
          per sq mi). It has 11 post offices, with the District Post Office
          bearing the postal code 45400.
        </p>
        The district was named after Ramechhap village. The word Ramechhap comes
        from two Nepali words, Ram (person's name) and chhap (mark). According
        to folklore, the village of Ramechhap was once occupied by the Tamang
        people. A Tamang member of the village, named Ram, was granted the role
        of mukhtiyari (village leader) by royal decree. Consequently, land
        ownership and other legal activities were authorized in the village by
        the stamp (chhap) of Ram. According to another legend, the Tamang people
        used to rear their domesticated animals such as buffalo, goats, etc. in
        an open meadow in the district. The word ra means 'goat', mey means
        'ox', and chhawa means their offspring; the meadow of the ra-mey-chhawa
        ultimately became "Ramechhap".
